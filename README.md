  <h1>WeatherHDS (Weather HTML Display System) but customized or something idk</h1>

  <p>A basic web app that displays weather from the weather.com API in the style of a 24/7 weather channel broadcast.</p>

  <h1>Configuration</h1>

  <p>*Node.js is required!</p>

  <p>Dependencies: Express.js, Path, and fs</p>
  <p>Main presentation and LDL locations can be edited in config.js. Please reload the page once restarting the server.</p>
  <p>The system rotates between locations once the last slide of the presentation is reached, it should loop back on the next location.</p>
  <p>slides.js manages how the slides work. Currently, it switches between the HTML containers every 10 seconds.</p>
  <h1>Features</h1>
  <s>-radar container that parses images from dd.weather.gc.ca and plasters it on a div on index.html.</s>
  nevermind we got rid of the radar lol
